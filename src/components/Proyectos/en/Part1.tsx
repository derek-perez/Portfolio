                <p style={{ width: '80%', lineHeight: '1.3' }}>
                    These are some of my most relevant projects in terms of <b>Web and Mobile Development</b>, because I have done more, but,
                    or they used <b>PHP</b> as Backend (and I do not present these because I no longer use PHP, I have migrated to NodeJs) or they were part of some course
                    in order to practice and learn. That is why I have decided not to show them.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And something important to highlight is that these projects have been done by myself
                    from absolutely <b>scratch</b>. All projects have <b>NodeJs</b> as backend.
                    And as for <b>UI/UX Design</b>, they are all that I have done, and here I show them to you.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now, the artificial intelligence models that I will present to you are models for different <b>Deep Learning</b> tasks.
                    They are not all the models I made, but they are the most relevant and those that solve "relatively" more complex tasks than the
                    other models I developed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I will present you the projects chronologically in their corresponding categories. And sorry, the projects are just in Spanish ðŸ¤­
